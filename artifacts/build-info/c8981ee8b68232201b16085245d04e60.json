Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ``` function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role.

The string is a URL-encoded sequence of key-value pairs that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`. There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`. - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`. - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum. - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum. If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example: - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain. - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`. - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`. - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum. - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum. If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example: - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain. - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example: - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain. - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`. - `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in `GovernorBravo`. - `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum. - `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum. If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params` key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example: - `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between for/against/abstain. - `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.
